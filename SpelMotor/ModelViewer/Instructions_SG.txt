Instructions for getting started with the Model Viewer:
	1 Un-zip desired version of ModelViewer, ex: ModelViewer_ver0.1
	2 In the ModelViewer-ver0.1folder:
		a) In Assets/3D folder add any models (.fbx) and textures (.dds)
		you want. Create a folder if you like. 
		ex: Assets/3D/I_am_testing_this
		with test_model.fbx, test_model_D.dds/test_model_M.dds/test_model_N.dds
		
		b) Run the .exe file: ModelViewer_Debug.exe or ModelViewer_Release.exe.
	Should work. :U

	If not @ an SP: Aki or Emanuel. In Discord.
