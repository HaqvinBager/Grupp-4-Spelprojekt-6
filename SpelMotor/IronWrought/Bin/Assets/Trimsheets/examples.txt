FBX:es that use trimsheets:
Place them anywhere in Assets/3D/
make sure they have a suffix that corresponds to the trimsheets they use.
Ex:
	EN_W_L1Stair_03_19G4_01_19_ts_1.fbx
	EN_W_L2Stair_04_19G4_01_19_ts_2.fbx

If the suffix is incorrect (or there is some other issue) the texture won't load. If the trimsheet doesn't exist the same thing will happen.
Nothing will break. (If it does please send a pm or @: Aki, Emanuel or Ellen.)

Number of trimsheets are decided by SG. Please inform how many trimsheets there are going to be( might be automated in the future)
